# VOLATILE BRANCH

This is the (unofficial) volatile branch of ZMK. It is a group of PRs that I have chosen to bundle together for testing. The branch is *volatile*. That is to say, unlike an unstable/nightly branch which may semi-frequently have breaking changes, this branch will spontaneously vanish and reappear with new batches of PRs to test. I may also decide to vary the specific name of this branch and instead make this README point to a different branch as the current volatile branch.

Essentially, this branch should not be used for production purposes at all. I thank any testers using this branch in advance, your time and effort is appreciated. 

The list of PRs that this branch consists of can be found in the commit history.
